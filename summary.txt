Summary: This project will be a fun arcade-style shooter game built in java. It is
similar to a Galaga shooter in which the player is at the bottom of the screen and must
avoid obstacles while shooting an enemy to earn as much points as possible. So far I have made a basic 
framework that allows for player movement and incoming obstacles. Next, I will start working to 
incorporate object collisions and shooting so the game is playable. I plan to add a leaderboard in the
and more obstacles in the future as well.

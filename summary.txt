Summary: This project will be a fun arcade-style monster battler game build in java. It is a
monster battling game with live minigames for combat. So far I have made a basic framework that 
handles monster instance creation, damage calculation, and the start of a battle sequence. Next, I 
will start working to incorporate live minigames so the game can be playable in a basic but cohesive 
sense. I plan to add levels and a leaderboard in the future as well.
